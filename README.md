# EVERYBODY COUNTS!

This is a little script I wrote to categories my dads accounts to save time preparing tax returns.

PapaParse is used to manipulate a CSV bank statement. 
Simple string matching with rules is used to add a 'from account' and  'to account' field to each entry.
Middleman is used for the static site

#### Run:
```
bundle install
middleman serve
```
Comments in `source/javascripts/all.js` describe how to modify it.
